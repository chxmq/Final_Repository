                    Char Dhams in Hinduism hold great importance. Every Hindu devotee dreams of visiting the holy Char Dhams to fulfill the spiritual quest of attaining salvation. It is said that glimpses of any one of the Char Dhams remove the sins of one’s life. Of all the major Char Dham shrines, two shrines play a very integral part in fulfilling the pious quest of attaining Moksha.

                    Lord Vishnu (the preserver of earth) and Lord Shiva (the destroyer of earth) are two of three most revered Lords in Hinduism. Offering prayers to these two Gods holds high significance in this religion.
