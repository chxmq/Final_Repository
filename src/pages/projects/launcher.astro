                    The RC Airplane Launcher is a project that we are currently
                    working on. The launcher is designed to launch RC airplanes
                    with precision and accuracy. It can ensure that the airplane
                    has a predictable and stable launch.

                    Hand launching RC airplanes remains the dominant method of
                    launching. However, it requires a certain level of skill and
                    experience. The RC Airplane Launcher aims to make the
                    launching process easier and more efficient.
